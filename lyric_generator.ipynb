come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i'm sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and
